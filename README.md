# üöÄ 3D Solar System

Welcome to the 3D Solar System! This project showcases a basic interactive model of our solar system using Three.js. You can observe the planets orbiting the Sun, control their speeds, and even switch between dark and light modes.

## ‚ú® Features
Realistic Planet Orbits: Watch planets revolve around the Sun at their respective speeds.
Individual Speed Control: Adjust the orbital speed of each planet using dedicated sliders.
Pause/Resume Animation: Control the flow of time in your solar system.
Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between a classic dark space theme and a brighter view.
Planet Labels on Hover: See the name of a planet when you hover your mouse over it.
Interactive Camera: Orbit around the solar system, zoom in and out.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run
Running this project is very simple, as it's a single HTML file!
Using Live Server VS Code Extension 

Install VS Code: If you don't have it, download and install Visual Studio Code.
Install Live Server extension: Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view , search for "Live Server" , and install it.

Open your project in VS Code: Go to File > Open Folder... and select the folder where your index.html and images are.
Go Live: Right-click on your index.html file in the VS Code Explorer and select "Open with Live Server". Your browser will automatically open the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
You can easily modify this project by editing the index.html file.
 Adjust Speeds: Change the value attribute of the speed input tags in the HTML to set different starting speeds.
Change Planet Sizes/Orbits: Modify the radius and _orbit_radius variables in the <script type="module"> section.

 Update Textures: Replace the image file paths (.jpg, .png) in the loadPlanetTexture and createMaterialArray functions with your own textures. Make sure your new images are in the same folder as the index.html file, or update the paths accordingly.

 Colors & Styles: Modify the CSS within the <style> tags or add more Tailwind CSS classes to customize the look and feel of the control panel and buttons.
